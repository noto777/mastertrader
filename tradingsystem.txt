Finalized System Requirements:
Environment Setup:
Web Framework: Flask or FastAPI (both are lightweight, scalable, and integrate well with APIs).
IB API: Use ib_insync for Interactive Brokers integration.
Charting: Use Plotly for interactive visualizations on the web front end.
Backtesting:
Use pre-downloaded historical data for backtesting.
Framework: Backtrader is a strong choice as it supports modular strategies, custom indicators (like RSI), and is well-documented.
Web Front End:
Dashboard:
Real-time updates using WebSocket.
Include key metrics: portfolio allocation, P&L, RSI signals, and current trades.
Display interactive charts for stock prices, RSI, and portfolio performance.
Features:
Live monitoring of the bot’s actions.
Controls for pausing/resuming the bot and changing key parameters (e.g., RSI thresholds, bankroll percentage).
Historical performance reports and backtest results.
Logging and Reporting:
Logs stored in local files and a database (SQLite for simplicity, PostgreSQL for scaling later).
Email alerts for key events:
RSI signal detected.
Orders executed or canceled.
Weekly rebalancing triggered.
Core Trading Logic:
Core Building (5%):

Buy 1% of the bankroll when 15-min 7-period RSI crosses above 30.
Sell ¾ of the position when 1% profit is achieved.
Repeat up to 20 times for each stock to reach the 5% target.
Use limit orders at the bid price; cancel and resubmit after 1 minute if unfilled.
Operate in all trading sessions (premarket, RTH, after-hours).
Trading Around the Core:

Buy 1% of the bankroll when conditions match.
Sell all shares at 1% profit.
Reduce the cost basis of the core position over time.
Core Position Exit:

Start selling the core when weekly 7-period RSI crosses above 75.
Sell 1% of the core position at a time as the price rises.
Ensure no stock exceeds 10% of the bankroll; stop buying and only sell to reduce exposure.
Weekly Rebalancing:

Adjust positions that exceed the 5%/10% thresholds.
Execution Behavior:
Buy Orders: Use limit orders at the bid price. Cancel after 1 minute and retry.
Sell Orders: Use limit orders as well to ensure precise execution.
Operate in all trading sessions (premarket, RTH, after-hours).
Backtesting Features:
Use historical data to simulate trades based on your logic.
Generate metrics like profit, drawdown, cost basis reduction, and P&L trends.
Proposed Modular Architecture:
Market Data Module:

Fetch live data from Interactive Brokers via ib_insync.
Fetch historical data for backtesting.
Signal Generation Module:

Calculate 7-period RSI (15-min and weekly).
Generate buy/sell signals based on RSI thresholds.
Order Execution Module:

Manage buy/sell orders (limit orders with retries).
Track open orders and lot-specific executions.
Portfolio Management Module:

Track portfolio allocation (core and trading positions).
Enforce 5% and 10% limits.
Weekly rebalancing logic.
Logging and Reporting Module:

Save logs locally and in the database.
Generate reports for trades, portfolio performance, and P&L.
Web Front End Module:

Real-time dashboard with WebSocket for updates.
Plotly charts for stock prices, RSI, and performance.
Controls for bot operation and parameter tuning.
Backtesting Module:

Load historical data for given stocks.
Simulate trades and evaluate strategy performance.
Next Steps:
Set Up the Environment:
Install Python libraries (ib_insync, Flask/FastAPI, Plotly, Backtrader, SQLAlchemy, etc.).
Start with a Skeleton Code:
Begin with basic modules (e.g., fetching live data and calculating RSI).
Iterative Development:
Build modules incrementally, test thoroughly, and integrate as needed.
Do you want me to start drafting the first piece of code, like fetching RSI signals or setting up the order execution logic?









Would you like me to:
Show you a proposed database schema for tracking lots?
Start with the IB API integration for lot management?
Begin with the order management system?
Also, should we track:
1. Individual lot performance metrics?
Cumulative cost basis reduction from trading lots?
Progress toward the 5% core target per symbol?
