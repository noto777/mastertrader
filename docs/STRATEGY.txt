AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEM STRATEGY
===============================

1. CORE STRATEGY COMPONENTS
--------------------------
A. Signal Generation (15-minute timeframe):
   - RSI Parameters:
     * Period: 7
     * Entry: Cross above 30
     * Entry Timing: Open of candle after a close above 30 (previous candle ≤ 30)
     * Profit Target: 1% using limit orders

B. Gap Detection:
   - Check first 15 minutes of pre-market
   - If gap up detected:
     * Cancel existing limit sell orders
     * Place new limit sell at (current price - 0.1%) or bid (whichever is lower)
     * If not filled in 10 seconds, cancel and retry

2. POSITION MANAGEMENT
---------------------
A. Core Positions:
   - Defined in configuration (e.g., AAPL 5%, TSLA 3%, TLT 2%)
   - Building Process:
     * Buy position = 1% of total account value
     * Sell 75% of position
     * Retain 0.25% as core
     * Repeat until target core % reached
     Example: 5% core target requires 20 cycles (20 * 0.25% = 5%)

B. Trading Positions:
   - Trade around core using same entry/exit rules
   - Sell 100% of trading positions at targets
   - Position Limits:
     * Maximum per stock: core% + 5%
     * Minimum cash: 20% of account
     * Maximum invested: 80% of account

3. RISK MANAGEMENT STATES
------------------------
A. Risk-Off Triggers (ANY of):
   - Weekly RSI closes above 70
   - Stock makes 52-week high
   - Stock makes all-time high
   
   Actions:
   - Stop new trades
   - Unwind core position:
     * Initial 5% sale
     * Additional 5% sale for every 2% price increase
     * Always sell lowest-cost-basis lots first

B. Risk-On Requirements (ALL required):
   - Weekly RSI must close below 70
   - Daily RSI must close below 30
   
   Actions:

   2. Second Priority: Resume trading around core

4. LOT MANAGEMENT
----------------
A. Position Tracking:
   - Track each lot separately
   - Use IB's specific lot/tax optimizer

   Example:
   - Lot 1: 100 shares @ $100 → sell @ $101
   - Lot 2: 100 shares @ $98 → sell @ $98.98

B. Cost Basis:
   - Track total cost basis across all shares
   - Include both core and trading positions
   - Use for tax optimization in sales
